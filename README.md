# RemindMe
Simple CLI tool for storing / reporting reminders and tasks

Features:

- Terribly written and disorganized code ensures a fun challenge for anyone who wants to take up an issue
- Non-unique functionality that several other tools already provide, replacing the clutter of a useful GUI to focus on making installation difficult
- Needless enums, implemented through static class variables, that suggest a framework and code style that is rarely adhered to throughout the project
